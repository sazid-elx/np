In 1945, Krasner and Pollock married and moved out to Springs, East Hampton, on the East End of Long Island, to get away from the city scene. (Pollock was already suffering from debilitating alcoholism.) There they clammed, rode bikes, and painted. Krasner, working in her upstairs bedroom studio, began her breakthrough Little Images series—its canvases small enough to fit on a bedside table—and made mosaiced tabletops. She imagined the dense compositions of her Little Images as unreadable hieroglyphics, thick with paint sometimes applied directly from the tube. Krasner also began working on collages—using paper and scraps from canvases she and Pollock had discarded—that demonstrated her admiration for Henri Matisse.<\/p>","description-two":"<p>In 1956, while Krasner was in Europe, Pollock died in a car crash. A year later, Krasner moved into the barn studio that Pollock had used on their property, and the scale and energy of her paintings expanded. Nature became an immersive theme: The Seasons (1957) stretched 17 feet wide, and Gaea (1966), after the Greek earth goddess, shows her moving toward broad swaths of color and rhythm. In 1965, she had her first solo exhibition at Whitechapel Gallery in London, and in 1975, at the Whitney Museum of American Art. She died in 1984, just a few months before her retrospective opened at MoMA.<\/p>","second-image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/20-photograph-by-irving-penn-lee-krasner-springs-ny-1972-the-irving-penn-foundation_1_4b78be99-515f-41c5-a375-f2a67dae06ff.png","third-image":"shopify:\/\/shop_images\/Lee-Krasner-Fecundity-1960-oil-on-canvas-87-3-slash-8-x-70-1-slash-2-inches-221-dot-9-x-179-dot_1_1beb9374-f767-4e66-8d7c-54d068e9c552.png"}},"d2e788ae-0e8a-443a-8a26-4cb3ae36fcb5":{"type":"spacer-block","settings":{"spacer-height":90}}},"block_order":["template--16696287002882__18a1d336-8c43-450a-8f1f-49b2f615cbb1-1676557228ebaa2c3f-1","template--16696287002882__18a1d336-8c43-450a-8f1f-49b2f615cbb1-1676557228ebaa2c3f-0","d2e788ae-0e8a-443a-8a26-4cb3ae36fcb5"],"settings":{}},"7e9d8ff3-5889-49d4-b4e9-9ea1a078fb26":{"type":"np-single-border-button","settings":{"button-text":"shop the collection","button-url":"\/","font-size":12.5,"button-text-color":"#2b2725","enable-border":true,"padding-top-bottom":10,"padding-left-right":60,"button-position":"center"}}},"order":["main","e08a600c-3179-47da-8063-5c72c941e516","90284f73-ac7e-430a-a67c-ec2af8c37478","c548b6a2-6579-46ad-9ffb-38ad96a07864","9a9c3654-836a-4582-ab52-9d329d14378c","7130d760-f8b5-4615-8de1-7c8f17ecb3a9","637865d6-d6da-4ae5-8174-3ff0ce0ec16d","18a1d336-8c43-450a-8f1f-49b2f615cbb1","7e9d8ff3-5889-49d4-b4e9-9ea1a078fb26"]}
